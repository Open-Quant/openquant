    <p class="muted">Common decisions and operating guidance for OpenQuant-rs.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Is OpenQuant-rs functionally complete?</h2>
  <p>Yes for the current library scope. The project is in stabilization and productionization mode with CI, benchmarks, and release checks.</p>

  <h2>Why is one SADF test excluded from fast CI?</h2>
  <p><code>test_sadf_test</code> is intentionally isolated because it is long-running. It remains covered in dedicated slow/nightly validation paths.</p>

  <h2>How do I validate performance regressions?</h2>
  <p>Run both benchmark suites, collect the latest snapshot, and compare against baseline with threshold checks from <code>scripts/check_bench_thresholds.py</code>.</p>

  <h2>Can I publish now?</h2>
  <p>Yes once release checks pass in your target environment, including a successful <code>cargo package -p openquant</code> run and docs deployment verification.</p>

  <h2>Where should I start reading the docs?</h2>
  <p>Start with <code>Subjects (AFML)</code>, then move to <code>Module Pages</code> for detailed formulas and implementation examples.</p>
