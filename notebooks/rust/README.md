# Rust Notebook Companions (Evcxr-friendly)

These files mirror the Python notebook workflows with Rust snippets suitable for Evcxr/Jupyter Rust cells.

## Files

1. `01_event_labeling_pipeline.rs`
2. `02_seq_bootstrap.rs`
3. `03_feature_diagnostics.rs`
4. `04_portfolio_construction.rs`
5. `05_risk_overlays.rs`

## Evcxr quickstart

```rust
:dep nalgebra = "0.32"
:dep openquant = { path = "crates/openquant" }
```

Paste snippets from each file into Evcxr cells.
