# UI/UX Rubric for Astro Docs

Use this rubric before marking a docs section complete.

## Visual system

1. Define and use clear tokens (spacing, color, radius, border, shadow).
2. Use a deliberate type scale and avoid default-looking typography.
3. Keep contrast high for body text and code blocks.

## Information design

1. Maintain clear heading hierarchy and section rhythm.
2. Keep line lengths readable.
3. Break dense sections with tables/cards only when they improve scanability.

## Code experience

1. Code blocks must be legible on mobile and desktop.
2. Avoid overflow clipping and tiny font sizes.
3. Keep syntax and spacing consistent.

## Interaction and motion

1. Use minimal purposeful motion only (no decorative animation spam).
2. Keep hover/focus states subtle and clear.
3. Ensure keyboard navigation remains obvious.

## Anti-slop checks

1. No generic one-size-fits-all gradient hero blocks.
2. No repetitive identical card stacks without hierarchy.
3. No filler copy; every section should carry concrete information.

## Review flow

1. Run docs locally (`cd docs-site && npm run dev`).
2. Review subject index and at least one module page.
3. Verify desktop and mobile layout before completion.
